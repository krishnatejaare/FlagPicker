Can execute this maven project by building:
 mvn clean package -DskipTests=true

 Now start running the main method in /src/main/java/com/asm/FlagPicker/FlagPickerApplication.java:

 Now open the localhost:8080
 
 
 
 I have used:
 CSS, HTML and JavaScript for front end.
 
 I have used Spring Boot for the back end.
 
 In Backend:
 I have used two models one for CountryFlag and Continent.
 I have used a Controller to map the URL's and render the response.
 I have used a service class to hold the logic.


List of Items To be Done: Tried to use this: but unable to see anything on localhost:8080/metrics or localhost:8080/actuator

Metrics can be logged using this Spring boot Actuator:

<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
 <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
